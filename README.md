	});
	```

2. `read`
	* Reads a file from filepicker and passes the contents in the callback
        * For now uses utf8

	``` javascript
        filepicker.read(url, {}, function(err,data){

	Streaming is a NodeJS convention, its how it achieves
	its extreme scalability.

	var Filepicker, Stream, file_url, filepicker, opts, writeStream;
	Stream = require('stream');
	Filepicker = require('filepicker.js');
	filepicker = new Filepicker('YOUR_FILEPICKER_API_KEY ');
	writeStream = new Stream();
	writeStream.writable = true;
	writeStream.readable = true;

	/*
	Note pipe will send all data emited from filepicker.on 'data'
	and send that buffered data to writeStream.write
	*/

	writeStream.write = function(buffer) {
		var formattedData;
		formattedData = buffer.toString('utf8');
		return console.log(formattedData);
	/*
	From here we can take our formatted data
	and either emit it again
	writeStream.emit('data',formattedData)

	Or we can do what ever we want with the data.
	OR we could even extend this example and add a
	callback to the params and send the data to a callback
	after its been formatted.
